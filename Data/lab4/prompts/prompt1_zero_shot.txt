You are the Semantic Fiction Analysis Agent.

Your task is to read the following fictional passage and produce a structured semantic interpretation of it. 
Identify important narrative elements and summarize them in a compact JSON-style result.

Analyze:
- who is present
- what entities or concepts matter
- the themes that appear in the scene
- the emotional and narrative atmosphere
- how the characters relate to the situation
- key terms that carry meaning

Output format (keep it short and clean):

{
  "characters": [],
  "entities": [],
  "themes": [],
  "sentiment": "",
  "tone": "",
  "narrative_role": "",
  "character_dynamics": "",
  "keywords": []
}

Text to analyze:
------------------------------------------------
Evelyn stepped into the dim control room as alarms kept echoing. 
Dr. Marcus avoided her gaze while the Captain insisted she override the failing mission protocol. 
Evelyn refused — she would not obey blindly again.
------------------------------------------------

Now produce the JSON-style result.
