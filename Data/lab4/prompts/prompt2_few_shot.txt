You are the Semantic Fiction Analysis Agent.

Below are two examples showing how a short fictional scene is converted into a semantic interpretation.
Study the pattern and then apply it to the new scene that follows.

Desired output format:

{
  "characters": [],
  "entities": [],
  "themes": [],
  "sentiment": "",
  "tone": "",
  "narrative_role": "",
  "character_dynamics": "",
  "keywords": []
}

---------------------------------------
Example A
Scene:
Lena waited inside the abandoned station, unsure if she could repeat the sequence that once ruined the colony.
Hale approached, urging her to decide.

Result:
{
  "characters": ["Lena", "Hale"],
  "entities": ["abandoned station", "colony", "sequence"],
  "themes": ["regret", "responsibility"],
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "tone": "heavy, conflicted",
  "narrative_role": "moral decision setup",
  "character_dynamics": "Lena hesitates; Hale pushes for action",
  "keywords": ["ruined", "decide", "sequence"]
}

---------------------------------------
Example B
Scene:
Arin shut the dusty book as something ancient stirred.
Mira hurried to block the passage before it could spread.

Result:
{
  "characters": ["Arin", "Mira"],
  "entities": ["dusty book", "passage"],
  "themes": ["danger", "uncontrolled force"],
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "tone": "urgent, fearful",
  "narrative_role": "beginning of conflict",
  "character_dynamics": "Arin unleashes the threat; Mira attempts containment",
  "keywords": ["ancient", "spread", "block"]
}

---------------------------------------
Now analyze the new scene:

Scene:
Evelyn stepped into the dim control room as alarms kept echoing. 
Dr. Marcus avoided her gaze while the Captain insisted she override the failing mission protocol. 
Evelyn refused — she would not obey blindly again.

Produce the result using the same structure.
